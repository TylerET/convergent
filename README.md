Convergent is a meetup/social media app designed to allow users to find interesting activities or people that share interests adjacent to the user based on an initial survey. We find that advertising and engagement algorithms on the internet cause niche interest to consume one's feed, with very little diversity. We seek to change that by allowing users to find not only exactly what they are looking for in the moment, but to offer them a chance to branch out and explore new topics, themes and events.

Convergent’s design and user experience should be familiar to people who have navigated social media apps before. As a side-effect of most other social media algorithms allowing users to stay engaged to highly curated content, we expect that user tolerance for learning new UI’s or navigating complex systems to be diminished. Thus, familiarity allows quick integration of new users, high retention, and greater usability.
